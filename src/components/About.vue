                        <p>
                          Hey there! I'm <strong>Poul</strong>, and while I spend my days working with software, my curiosity stretches <em>far beyond the screen</em>. I'm someone who finds joy in the <strong>intricate details of digital systems</strong>, and equally, in the profound beauty of <em>classical music and opera</em>. There's a special kind of resonance in a complex score or a powerful aria that sparks my mind in a truly unique way.

                        <h3 class="text-2xl text-primary font-semibold">My Journey to Code</h3>
                        <p>
                          My path to software <strong>wasn't a straight line</strong>. As a teenager, I was fascinated by <em>electronics and microcontrollers</em>, always tinkering and building. It was like designing a special circuit for a unique purpose. That <strong>hands-on spirit</strong>, that feeling of making something tangible work, never really left me. My formal journey began with <em>business administration</em>, where I grew captivated by how decisions are made and how data shapes a company's direction. That initial curiosity about business insights and their impact led me to dive deeper into <strong>computer engineering</strong>. What's been particularly rewarding is that I've always <strong>combined studying with working</strong>. This allowed me to see firsthand how theoretical concepts and <em>'best practices'</em> immediately impacted my daily work, strengthening my understanding and capabilities. This journey deepened my fascination with getting the <strong>right feedback, at the right time</strong>, to truly empower a business, and I feel like it's the same kind of design challenge, just on a different scale. It's truly amazing to live and work in a field that resonates so strongly with my <em>earliest hobbies</em>.

                        <p>
                          When I'm not immersed in code or thinking about data, you'll often find me with my nose in a book, maybe jotting down thoughts for an essay â€“ I enjoy <strong>putting ideas on paper</strong>. And speaking of things that click, I'm also really interested in <em>cars and their mechanics</em>. There's a surprising parallel between figuring out a tricky software problem and understanding how an engine works its magic.
                          <br>
                          I'm also a <strong>long-time advocate for free and open-source software (FOSS)</strong>. From embracing <em>Linux and Emacs</em> to championing <strong>internet privacy</strong> and <em>resilient, censorship-resistant networks</em>, these principles have been a personal cause for years.

                        <p>
                          As for the work itself, I'm focused on building things that are <strong>practical and effective</strong>. I've learned that with <em>Python</em>, <strong>simplicity in design is truly everything</strong>. My years of working with <em>Java</em> taught me a lot about how sustainable code relies on being <strong>multi-platform</strong> and having <em>well-defined patterns</em>. Lately, I'm spending time exploring <strong>Clojure</strong>, which is a really interesting language that I'm keen to use for personal projects down the road. I find satisfaction in figuring out how to make robust systems that <strong>just... work</strong>.
